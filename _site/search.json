Once you‚Äôre happy with the result and you want to automate the workflow, then use the instructions below to setup a scheduled workflow using GitHub Actions.\nWhen developing an automation task, it is always good to think about how to run it starting from a fresh OS! It is as if you have a new system and you try to run your script there. A few question to ask yourself:\n\nWhere should I start?\nWhat are software/libraries I need to install before running the script?\nWhere can I find the script I want to run?\nDo I need to pass some environment variables or sensitive information like passwords?\n\nHow should I pass sensitive information like passwords or tokens?\n\n\nI will answer above questions for my workflow. Hopefully this will give you enough information to automate your task!"
